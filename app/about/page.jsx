This could be you, me, or any engineer who adds skills to their resume they don&apos;t fully master, either to stand out in the competitive job market or to secure an interview. Often, the realization of lacking complete knowledge comes when preparing for an interview. Now, with the emergence of AI tools like ChatGPT, many of us have fallen into the habit of simply doing <strong>&#96;Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V&#96;</strong> without truly understanding the logic behind the code.</p>
